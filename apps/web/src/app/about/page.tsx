                        Culture does not always die in battles. It rarely ends with a bang. Most often, culture dies in silence.

                        It dies in the pause between a question asked by a grandchild and the silence of a grandparent who has forgotten the answer. It dies when a dialect spoken for a thousand years is replaced by a standard textbook. It dies when the last person who knows the specific prayer for the harvest takes that secret with them to the grave.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        In the Himalayas, we are witnessing a quiet extinction. Our history is not written in stone or stored in cloud servers; it is etched in the fragile, fading neural pathways of our elders.

                        The Himalayas have always been more than a geological barrier; they were a cradle of civilization.

                        From the temple-builders of the <strong>Katyuri Dynasty</strong> to the trans-Himalayan traders who walked the Silk Routes to Tibet, our ancestors carved a life out of rock. They survived the brutality of the <strong>Gorkhali Raj</strong>, the extraction of the Colonial era, and the harshness of the terrain.
