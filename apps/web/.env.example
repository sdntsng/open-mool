# Example environment variables for the Open Mool web application
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values if needed

# ============================================================
# CURRENTLY NO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE REQUIRED
# ============================================================
# The web application is configured as a static export without
# API routes or server-side features. It does not require any
# environment variables for basic functionality.

# ============================================================
# FUTURE API INTEGRATION (Optional)
# ============================================================
# If you integrate with the Open Mool API or external services
# in the future, you may need to add variables like:

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.openmool.org
# API endpoint for the Open Mool backend

# ============================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================
# - Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser
# - Other variables are only available during build time
# - Never commit .env.local or files containing secrets to git
