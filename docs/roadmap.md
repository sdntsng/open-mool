## 🔮 Phase 4: Decentralization & Governance (The Mirror)

### 4.1 "Mool Nodes" (Federation)
- **Concept:** Allow partner institutions (Universities, NGOs) to host read-only mirrors of specific collections.
- **Tech:** Containerized "Pocket Archive" (Next.js + SQLite) deployable on local servers.
- **Goal:** Resilience against central failure and localized access in low-connectivity zones.

### 4.2 The Content Trust (Licensing)
- **Legal Framework:** Establish the "Open Mool Foundation" to hold data in trust.
- **Licensing Model:**
    - **Code:** MIT (Fully Open).
    - **Data:** Custom "Heritage License" (research/education free, commercial with revenue share).
- **Permaweb Backup:** Periodic snapshots of the verified vault to Arweave/IPFS.
