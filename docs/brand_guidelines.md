# Brand Guidelines: Open Mool

**The Essence:** Open Mool is not a company. It is a Public Utility for Culture.
We are building the "Digital Ark" for the Himalayas. Our brand voice must balance the urgency of preservation with the optimism of technology.

## 1. The Manifesto
*To be used in "About Us" pages, README files, and Recruitment.*

> "Culture does not die in battles; it dies in silence. From the valleys of Kashmir to the hills of Uttarakhand and the peaks of Himachal, our history is stored in the fragile memory of elders. Every time an elder passes away without sharing their story, a library burns down.
>
> Open Mool is the firebreak. We are an open collective of engineers, historians, and locals building the sovereign digital infrastructure to capture, code, and immortalize Himalayan heritage. While we plant our first seeds in Uttarakhand, our canopy covers the entire mountain belt. We don't just store the past; we make it readable for the future."

**Tagline:** The Source Code of the Himalayas.

## 2. Core Identity Pillars

### A. The Guardian (Sanrakshak)
- **Concept:** We are protective but open. We treat data with the reverence of a holy scripture and the security of a bank vault.
- **Application:** When we ask for data, we don't say "Upload File." We say "Preserve a Story." We don't say "User," we say "Contributor."

### B. The Bridge (Setu)
- **Concept:** We stand exactly between the ancient (Jagar, Vedas, Dialects) and the future (AI, LLMs, Vector Databases).
- **Application:** Our visual language is minimal and futuristic (see Design Specs), but our content is deeply rooted. We explain AI in terms of preservation, not automation.

### C. The Open Commons (Saajha)
- **Concept:** This belongs to no one and everyone. Like Wikipedia or Linux.
- **Application:** We always credit the source. We champion "Data Sovereignty" - the idea that the culture belongs to the people who lived it, not the platform that hosts it.

## 3. Scope & Ambition (The "Pan-Himalayan" Lens)
**We are not just a state archive; we are a civilizational archive.**

- **The Scope:** While operations begin in Uttarakhand, our brand narrative encompasses the entire Himalayan range (including Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Nepal, and the North East).
- **The Common Thread:** We focus on the shared "Pahadi" identity - the resilience of mountain life, the oral traditions of nature worship, and the specific dialects of high-altitude communities.
- **Why this matters:** A broader scope attracts global researchers and funding, positioning us as the definitive diverse dataset for the region, not just a local project.

## 4. Tone of Voice

### WE ARE:
- **Urgent but Calm:** We know time is running out, but we build with steady precision.
    - *Bad:* "Hurry up and upload before it's gone!"
    - *Good:* "The window to capture these voices is closing. Let us begin today."
- **Authoritative but Humble:** We are technologists, but we bow to the wisdom of the elders.
    - *Bad:* "Our AI is better than your grandmother's memory."
    - *Good:* "Our AI ensures your grandmother's memory never fades."
- **Communal:** We speak as "We/Us" (the collective), never "I/Me" (the founder).

### WE ARE NOT:
- **Commercial:** We never sell. We preserve.
- **Nostalgic/Weepy:** We don't cry about the past; we engineer solutions for it.
- **Mystical/Vague:** We respect spirituality, but we discuss it with the clarity of an archivist.

## 5. Verbal Identity & Vocabulary
To create a distinct "world," we use a specific lexicon that elevates standard tech terms into cultural concepts.

| Standard Tech Term | The Open Mool Term | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User | **Guardian / Scout** | Instills responsibility and belonging. |
| Upload | **Contribution / Submission** | Implies value, not just data transfer. |
| Database | **The Vault (Kosh)** | Feels precious and secure. |
| AI Processing | **Deciphering / Codifying** | Sounds like an archaeological act. |
| Admin | **Archivist** | Shifts role from "manager" to "historian." |
| Login | **Enter the Archive** | Creates a sense of place. |

## 6. Community Guidelines (The "Belonging" Factor)

**For the Contributor (The Scout):**
"You are the boots on the ground. This archive is empty without you. Whether you record one song or a hundred stories, you are writing history."

**For the Developer:**
"This is not just another repo. You are writing the code that will teach the next generation of AI how to speak our language. Commit with pride."

**For the Researcher:**
"This data is open, but it is sacred. Use it to illuminate, not to exploit."

## 7. Visual & Brand Synergy
*Referring to "Design Specs: Himalayan Minimalism"*

- **Why Minimalism?** We use "Snow & Vermilion" because the design should never overpower the story. The brand is the frame, not the painting.
- **Why "Eczar" Font?** It looks carved. It reminds the user that what they are reading is permanent.
- **The Red Line (Sutra):** In our branding, the "Red Thread" represents lineage. It connects the elder in the video to the student watching it on a phone.

## 8. The "Call to Action" (CTA) Strategy
Our CTAs should never feel transactional. They should feel like invitations to a movement.

- *Generic:* "Sign Up" → **Open Mool:** "Join the Guardians"
- *Generic:* "Upload Video" → **Open Mool:** "Archive a Story"
- *Generic:* "Donate" → **Open Mool:** "Fuel the Mission"
- *Generic:* "Learn More" → **Open Mool:** "Explore the Roots"
